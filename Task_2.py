#Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
#2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
#3.   Displays the final sum.
 
i=1
num1=0
while i<=50:
    num1=num1+i
    i=i+1

print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: ", num1)
